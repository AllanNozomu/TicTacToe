# TicTacToe [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
Simple TicTacToe game using Elm to practice the language use. 

You can check a live demo [here](https://allannozomu.github.io/TicTacToe/)

It was my first little project using Elm. Please, if you have any question, suggestions or even a issue, you can contact me ;D

I have updated it to work with Elm 0.19
